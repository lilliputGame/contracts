# Game Introduction

Lilliput is an SLG game based on the scenario of a race of miniature people building
a tribe to help their survival and prosperity in a dangerous world.

Players can cultivate their tribe by recruiting workers, collecting resources,
upgrading buildings and researching technology across the Lilliput Kingdom. Players
are able to train warriors and raise pets to strengthen their armies.
Players in command of an army can take part in the PVE game Secret Challenge.
They can attack other people's cities through PVP to plunder their resources, which
can be used to upgrade their own cities and advance their technology to develop
stronger armies.

Players can also take part in PVP ranked matches against other players in offensive
and defensive battles. Victory in ranked matches earns the player points, and each
season is ranked according to the points. Token rewards are awarded at the end of
the season according to the players ranking.

# Play to Earn

The main access to Tokens in the game is by participating in ranked matches.
Winning in ranked matches earns points, and each season you are ranked
according to your points. At the end of each season you are rewarded with a
large amount of Tokens according to your ranking.

The ranked matches match players based on their points, and after a
successful match, they enter a sealed battlefield to compete.
The two parties in the battle are the attackers and the defenders. The units
involved in the battle are the players themselves, the recruited armies and
their summoned pets.

If the attacker destroys the core building of the defender within the time
limit, the attacker wins, otherwise the defender wins.

# NFT â€“ Pets 

One of the most important combat units in the game, pets can be
extracted by the player as NFTs and traded freely in the marketplace
in exchange for tokens.

Players can acquire pets by buying NFTs in the marketplace, or by
participating in in-game challenges and events.

There is a limit to the number of pets a player can carry into a battle.
Once players reach a certain number of pets, they can fuse pets of the
same type and star level to obtain a higher star level and improve
their battle power. Players will trade their extra pets in the
marketplace and use tokens to purchase the pets they need.
